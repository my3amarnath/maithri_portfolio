            <p>
            I graduated from Maynooth University, Ireland in 2020 with a Masterâ€™s Degree 
            in Data Science and Analytics. I would say I am an evolving Data Scientist 
            with extensive experience working with one of the leading semiconductor 
            manufacturing industries through optimizing their manufacturing processes 
            by collecting process data, pre-processing, and identifying trends and 
            opportunities to enhance the module performance by analyzing the data sets.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I have a wide range of hobbies and passions that keep me busy.
              From reading, playing sports, traveling, to making potraits.
              I am always seeking new experiences and love to keep myself
              engaged and learning new things.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>

              and that&#39;s what I strive to do, I have a passion for store telling and
              technology and a desire to always push the limits of what is
              possible. I am excited to see where my career takes me and am
              always open to new opportunities. ðŸ™‚
